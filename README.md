# dosimplex - D OpenSimplexNoise Implementation

OpenSimplexNoise is a noise algorithm similar to perlin noise and simplex noise. The big plus however is that its not patentet but released into the public domain.

## What is this now
This project tries to implement the reference implementation (wich is in java) in D. 
Currently, this is in development.
